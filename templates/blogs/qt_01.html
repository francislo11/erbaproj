  <h1>Is It More Eco-Friendly to Repair, Replace, or Recycle Appliances?</h1>

  <!-- Paragraphys -->
  <p>
    Home appliances, especially older models, can use a lot of energy. Many
    environmentally minded consumers wonder if it’s more earth-friendly to
    repair old appliances, replace them with more energy-efficient models, or
    recycle them.
    <br />
    If you want to learn about eco appliance repair, environmentally friendly
    appliances, and how to recycle older models, XXX is here to help.

  <h3>Should I Repair My Old Appliance?</h3>
  <!-- Paragraphys -->
  <p>
    In general, it’s usually more environmentally and economically friendly to
    keep appliances until they start to malfunction frequently. Knowing when to
    repair and replace broken appliances will help you on your sustainability
    journey.
    <br />
    Given their initial investment, large appliances—such as fridges, washers,
    dryers, and ovens—should be preserved for as long as reasonably possible.
    It’s generally recommended that you repair your larger appliances for the
    first 5 to 10 years, depending on how often they’re used. If you’ve
    purchased something of exceptionally high quality, this period can extend to
    20 years.
    <br />
    Smaller appliances like microwaves are likely only worth repairing if
    they’re relatively new or under five years old. The exception would be if
    the repair is quite simple and can be done without paying too much out of
    pocket.

  <h3>When is the Right Time to Upgrade My Appliances?</h3>
  <!-- Paragraphys -->
  <p>
    When appliances start to break down, most people think first of the
    inconvenience—and reasonably so. Knowing that you must beat the clock to
    save your rapidly defrosting freezer items makes it hard to consider much
    else.
    <br />
    Before trying to resolve the inconvenience immediately, take a moment to
    reflect on the environmental implications of your decision. Extending the
    life of an energy-guzzling appliance may only further drive up your power
    bill and exacerbate your carbon footprint. It can be difficult to know what
    is worse for the planet: keeping an inefficient machine running,
    contributing to technology waste by throwing appliances away, or trying your
    hand at recycling appliances. The following questions will help you
    determine which path to take.
    <br />
    How old is your appliance? Old appliances are seldom as energy efficient as
    newer, eco-friendly appliances. Thanks to the marvels of modern technology,
    environmentally friendly home appliances built to run using less power are
    popular and accessible. If the appliances in your home are more than 10 to
    15 years old, they may be expensive to repair and detrimental to the
    environment.
    <br />
    Does your appliance still work well? There’s a distinct difference between
    an appliance that works and an appliance that works well. An appliance that
    runs smoothly will require less power to function, meaning less strain on
    precious resources. Performance and the sounds produced by your appliance
    can be a good indicator of how well your machine works.
    <br />
    Will an appliance upgrade be worthwhile? For an upgrade to be worthwhile,
    you’ll need to weigh the economic and environmental costs of replacing your
    appliance. For example, if your 15-year-old fridge needs new coils, a
    complete replacement may be more practical than spending half the price of a
    new one to keep an old, inefficient appliance running.
  </p>

  <h3>What are the Benefits of Replacing Old Appliances?</h3>
  <!-- Paragraphys -->
  <p>
    It’s easy to see the benefit of replacing an old appliance that isn’t
    working properly or requires frequent repairs. However, even when old
    appliances are working well enough, you may want to consider upgrading your
    home appliances to be kinder on the planet.
