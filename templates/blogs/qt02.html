<h1>What is the Best Oven for Baking? Comparing Gas, Electric, & Convection Ovens</h1>

<!-- Paragraphys -->
<p>Have you been watching popular baking shows and want to create something of your own? Whether you dream of making a mouthwatering, sugar-spun confection or simply want to bake a cake for your child’s birthday, you may be wondering if your current oven is the best oven for baking at home. 
<br>
  Though the best oven for baking depends on your baking preferences and what you make most often, you can certainly create baked masterpieces no matter which model you have. 
  <br>
  Here are some tips on finding the right oven for your kitchen, so you can officially get out those cookie molds and soufflé ramekins and get to cooking! We outline the pros and cons of gas, electric, and convection ovens to help you learn which one is best for you.

  <h3>Using a Gas Oven for Baking</h3>
<!-- Paragraphys -->
<p>Pros of a Gas Oven
  <p class="font-weight-normal">- When considering an electric vs. a gas oven for baking, keep in mind that the heat on a gas oven is instant. It heats up very quickly.
  </p>
  <p class="font-weight-normal">- If your home is already equipped with a gas line, a gas oven may be more cost-effective to install than an electric oven.</p>
  
  <br>
  
  Cons of a Gas Oven
  <p class="font-weight-normal">- The internal temperature can fluctuate widely in a gas oven, so it doesn’t heat as evenly as electric or convection ovens.</p>
  <p class="font-weight-normal">- Most gas ovens have hot spots, affecting how evenly food is cooked. The inside of a gas oven tends to be more humid than other oven types, leading to issues with food browning and crisping.</p>
